        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Well hello, and welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Anthony Yannos and I am I front end developer from Toronto, Ontario, Canada üçÅ.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding at night or on the weekends, I can be found working at a digital marketing agency where I manage a team of web developers. We work on everything from location landing pages, to full website builds for some pretty well-known clients around the world. Before this role, I worked for a little over five years in the healthcare industry. I got to do some technical project management, but for the most part, these roles were more of an integrated role of webmaster and a creative master of none (graphic design, videography, photography, and even some animations).</p>
        <p>Both companies were using CMS' (like WordPress, SharePoint and DNN) so at the time I didn't really feel the need to continue learning web development further than the skills I had going into the job. They just made things easy.</p>
        <p>But then things became annoying and restricted. Now, that's not to say CMS' aren't great, they're absolutely necessary for a lot of website builds, but you really need to know code well to pay able to have full control over your CMS. That's what has led me onto the path of learning to code.</p>
        <p>Take a look around and hit me up if you want to chat. Whether you're looking for someone to build your website, or want to collaborate on a project, I'm always looking to build new relationships with creative folk. Hope to hear from you soon...Cheers!</p>
